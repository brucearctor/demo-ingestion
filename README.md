# demo-ingestion

## Trying some 'serverless' rather 'fast' data ingestion pipelines...




### OpenTofu Explore

This is my first exploration with OpenToFu, so adding/exploring some new tools

ex: https://github.com/tofuutils/pre-commit-opentofu and https://github.com/gamunu/vscode-opentofu



##### TODO

* configure buf registry
...  REMOTE config still not working.  That'll be a cleanup item.



## CREDS
Esp. on 'new' devcontainer container:

`gcloud init` .. and to through login flow
also `gcloud auth application-default login`
These are both while doing local/testing, ahead of tofu deploys happening as part of CI.
